Guidelines and Expectations
Experiment with the different properties that affect text display, and various text formats to create effective and interesting page design. You can use for reference the constitution.html and style.css posted, which is just a plain black and white text version using some very basic CSS.

Be creative and come up with the formatting (text, background, spacing) to make this jump out and catch a viewer's attention.

To receive full credit, you may NOT submit the sample CSS file for this assignment. It is provided as an example. You should create your own CSS file and add a few styles that you understand to it.

Once you are happy with how the text on the webpage looks, upload the files to the validators, and take screenshots:
